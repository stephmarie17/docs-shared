- Adds the ``SearchIndexType`` class, which you can pass
  when constructing a ``SearchIndexModel`` instance. This change
  allows you to specify the index type when creating an Atlas
  Search or Vector Search index. To learn more, see |avs-index-link|.

- Delegates the implementation of the algorithms that implement
  the ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` and ``SCRAM-SHA-256`` authentication mechanisms to
  the configured JCA provider. This change means that your application
  can use a configured FIPS-compliant JCA provider to provide a higher
  level of security.

- Fixes an issue that caused the ``InsertOneResult.getInsertedId()`` and
  ``InsertManyResult.getInsertedIds()`` methods to return incorrect document IDs in
  some situations. This change is backported to {+driver-short+} v5.1.4
  and v4.11.4.

- When a sharded cluster operation is unsuccessful, the driver avoids selecting
  the same ``mongos`` server for operation retry attempts if other ``mongos``
  servers are available.
